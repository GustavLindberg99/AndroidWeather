### Locations

When you install the app, it will ask for permission to access your current location. If you allow it to, it will automatically show the weather at your current location (it might take some time for it to detect your location). Otherwise, you will need to enter a location manually.

In addition to your current location, you can also add additional locations by clicking on the button on the top right and clicking "Add City":

In the city list, you can click on a city to show the weather in that city. You can also scroll horizontally in the app to change cities.
