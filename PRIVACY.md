# Privacy Policy of Weather

This app uses the [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/) to get weather data, and sends requests to their server that include your location. How they handle that information is described in [their privacy policy](https://open-meteo.com/en/terms).

If you do not wish that your current location is sent to their server, you can disallow the app from accessing your location, in which case only locations that you entered manually will be sent to their server.
